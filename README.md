# P3-Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning-
<h1> Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning </h1>


<p> The goal of this project is to build a spam email classification model using various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. It uses NLP techniques to preprocess and vectorize the email data, and then trains the models to predict whether an email is spam or not.</p>

<h2>How to execute the Project</h2>

<p>Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed.
Required Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib
seaborn
nltk
scipy
  
You can install the required libraries using: pip install -r requirements.txt
  
Steps to Run

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-repository/spam-email-classification.git

Navigate to Project Directory:cd spam-email-classification

Prepare the Dataset: Place your spam email dataset in the appropriate folder or use the provided dataset.

Run the Model: 
Execute the Python script to train and test the spam classification model: python spam_email_classifier.py

View Results: The program will output the accuracy of the models on both the test and validation datasets. It will also display visualizations like confusion matrices and accuracy comparisons.

Additional Features
The project provides a comparison of multiple machine learning models and their performance.
The system also includes visualization of model performance metrics.</p>
